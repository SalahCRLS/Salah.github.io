<h1>Is AI Good for Students</h1>
<p>Have you ever used artificial intelligence for schoolwork? If so, you are part of the forty-percent of students who use artificial intelligence to generate work for school. Artificial intelligence offers many advantages when it comes to many aspects of work including, but not limited to instant feedback, data analysis, Instant text generation and online tutoring. With all of these easy to access benefits is artificial intelligence really good for students. Specifically, is artificial intelligence hurting or helping students more? Supporters of artificial intelligence commonly point out artificial intelligence helps them with quality of work, time management and future planning especially to the collegiate level. On the other hand, opponents of artificial intelligence tend to bring up that artificial intelligence can cause, possible isolation, cheating and bias responses. While concerns about artificial intelligence are valid, in this Op-Ed, I argue that artificial intelligence is very useful in a student’s life under some degree of control. First lets cover the possible drawbacks of artificial intelligence in education. Walden University has a page that explains the pros and cons of artificial intelligence in education. When writing about isolation the author states “ If students interact with a software program more than with a teacher, they can begin to feel disconnected and isolated. Their motivation and engagement may decrease, which could lead to an increase in dropout rates.” (5 Pros and Cons of  AIin the Education Sector). Whens kids lack human interaction they tend to have an absence of emotions compared to kids who constantly encounter human interaction. This is further supported by Children Bureau when they state “There have been tragic case studies of children who spent the earliest years of their lives in minimal human contact, who later demonstrated a severe lack of emotional development in the absence of love, language and attention.” (Social Connection On Child Development). Another point opponents of artificial intelligence in education like to bring up is, artificial intelligences contribution to cheating in a learning environment. The Forbes article Educators Battle Plagiarism As 89% Of Students Admit To Using OpenAI’s ChatGPT For Homework by Chris Westfall says that a tremendous  “48% of students admitted to using ChatGPT for an at-home test or quiz, 53% had it write an essay, and 22% had it write an outline for a paper.” (Westfall). This implies that students are losing motivation in using the skills they supposedly learned in class to do their work, and instead rely on artificial intelligence to complete their work in their place, which may even be incorrect. When most people think of artificial intelligence, society leads them to believe that artificial intelligence is perfect, but even artificial intelligence can display bias or misleading information. IBM Unites States state in Shedding light on  bias with real world examples that “AI bias, also referred to as machine learning bias or algorithm bias, refers to AI systems that produce biased results that reflect and perpetuate human biases within a society, including historical and current social inequality.” (IBM Data and AI Team). Artificial intelligence is designed to replicate human behavior, and since human data is inherently bias, so can AI. Now that we have covered disadvantages of artificial intelligence, lets move on to advantages. Quality of work hugely affects the trajectory of life for many students. Most teachers high school and beyond mostly grade by accuracy. Whether it is Math, Science, ELA, or Technology based, artificial intelligence is far better than humans at thinking ahead and displaying information more smoothly and accurately. In the Forbes article Advantages Of Artificial Intelligence (AI) In 2024 by Rashi Maheshwari, Rashi states that one of artificial intelligences biggest advantages is “Reducing Human Error: AI-enabled computers make zero errors if programmed correctly. AI models are based on predictive analysis thus leaving no scope for errors. Helps to save both time and resources and helps in achieving accurate and efficient results.” (Maheshwari). Artificial intelligence is designed to make zero errors, and use previous data to effectively produce relevant outputs, therefore saving time for humans. More on the topic of time, artificial intelligence is much more efficient than a human, therefore saving the valuable resource of time. According to Frontiers Human- versus Artificial Intelligence by Johan Egbert (Hans) Korteling it is mentioned that “Signals from AI systems propagate with almost the speed of light. In humans, the conduction velocity of nerves proceeds with a speed of at most 120 m/s, which is extremely slow in the time scale of computers” (Korteling ). Statistically speaking artificial intelligence is millions of times faster than human nerves and is available to the public 24/7, which is very useful when teachers are not available. Being so accurate and time efficient artificial intelligence can help student with planning for the future, whether it is assistance for a college essay, application or just feedback. Artificial intelligence can assist a student on their journey to adulthood and help prepare them for the real world. Now a reader may wonder “What about all the cons?”, and to that I say, that is where control comes to play. When it comes to anything in life, we need a perception of control. Control is the border between being beneficial and becoming a curse. Some forms of control I would suggest to be implemented would be better AI detection, stricter rules against plagiarism and limited AI availability through software. Overall, if all of these concepts of control are implemented into educational systems around the globe, it would be safe to conclude that the advantages of artificial intelligence would outweigh the disadvantages in a learning environment.<P>
